                            our use of it could mean that we are unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the
                            purposes of processing described in Section II (Use of Individual Data) or that you are
                            unable to make use of the Services. After you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may
                            be able to continue to process your Individual Data to the extent required or otherwise
                            permitted by applicable laws and regulations.

                            i) CLARIFICATION - All capitalised terms but undefined terms used herein shall bear the same
                            meaning as those defined in the Terms of Use and the GOAIRA Privacy Policy (accessible at
                            https://www.goaira.com/privacy/). This postscript forms part of the GOAIRA Privacy Policy.
                            In the event of any inconsistency between the GOAIRA Privacy Policy and this postscript,
                            this postscript shall prevail.
                            ii) ASSOCIATION WITH USERS AND CLIENTS - We provide as an add-on feature to facilitate
                            corporate billing for the Authorised Users’ use of GOAIRA’s Services in the course of work.
                            When an organisation (“Client”) chooses to utilise GOAIRA for Business, the Authorised User
                            is given the option of tagging his/her rides or other transactions to the Client or to tag
                            it as a individual ride. An Authorised User is referred to in the GOAIRA Privacy Policy as a
                            passenger.
                            As part of this feature, GOAIRA will disclose detailed trip and booking information that
                            Authorised Users have tagged as being for business purposes to the Client. Apart from this,
                            GOAIRA does not disclose other Individual Data of its Authorised Users to the Client.
                            Alternatively, an individual user may choose to set up a business profile within the App to
                            facilitate the tagging of business-related rides and to generate consolidated trip reports
                            to facilitate the submission of claims from his or her employer. When used in this mode, the
                            claims process is user-driven and the user’s employer need not be a Client.
                            For ease of reference, Authorised Users and individual users will each be referred to as a
                            “User” and collectively as “Users” in this postscript.
                            We data controller, so are our Clients in respect of any User and the processing of all
                            their Individual Data (including but not limited to Linking Data and Portal Data), GOAIRA
                            acts as a data controller. For further information on how GOAIRA collects, uses and
                            discloses Users’ Individual Data, please refer to the GOAIRA Privacy Policy.
                            Due to the way our Business works, we does not process any Individual Data for and on behalf
                            of the Client. Accordingly, GOAIRA is not the data processor of the Client, but an
                            independent data controller in respect of all Individual Data that it processes in the
                            course of providing the GOAIRA for Business feature. Likewise, the Client is an independent
                            data controller of the Individual Data (e.g. the Linking Data and Portal Data) that it
                            discloses to and/or receives from GOAIRA.
                            As independent controllers, GOAIRA and the Client individually determine the purposes and
                            means of processing Individual Data, subject to the provisions set out in the Terms of Use
                            and this Privacy Policy. GOAIRA and the Client are also individually responsible to ensure
                            the protection of Individual Data under their charge.

                            iii) WHAT INDIVIDUAL DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISCLOSED
                            We collect as a part of GOAIRA for Business in order to provide the GOAIRA for Business
                            feature, the individual user or the Client will be required to provide the following
                            information about the Authorised User to GOAIRA:
                            • full name;
                            • business email address; and
                            • other identifying information about the authorised user as reasonably requested by GOAIRA.
                            • GOAIRA will use this information for the purposes of authenticating the User;
                            • where applicable, linking the Authorised User’s account with the Client’s GOAIRA for
                            Business account or tracking the Authorised User’s business profile bookings on the Apps, as
                            the case may be;
                            • where applicable, verifying the Corporate Billing status of such Authorised User from time
                            to time; and
                            • contacting the User in accordance with the purposes set out in the GOAIRA Privacy Policy.
